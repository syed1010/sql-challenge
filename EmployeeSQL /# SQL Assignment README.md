## Description
In this assignment, we were tasked with creating tables to represent a database schema based on provided CSV files, importing data into these tables, and performing various data analysis tasks using SQL queries.

## Requirements
The requirements for the assignment were as follows:
- Define table schemas for six CSV files.
- Ensure that all required columns are defined, set to the correct data type, and have appropriate constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL, etc.).
- Import data from CSV files into corresponding SQL tables.
- Perform specific data analysis tasks using SQL queries.

## Instructions
To replicate the assignment:
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database.
2. Execute the SQL scripts provided in this repository to create tables and import data.
3. Run the SQL queries provided to perform data analysis tasks.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis tasks performed in this assignment include:
- Listing employee information.
- Filtering employees hired in a specific year.
- Retrieving manager information for each department.
- Extracting department information for each employee.
- Filtering employees based on specific criteria (first name, last name).
- Generating frequency counts of employee last names.

## ERD Diagram
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrating the relationships between the tables in the database schema is provided in the repository.
